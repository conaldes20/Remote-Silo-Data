# Real Time Grain Supply Details
This application was developed in 2018 and deployed in 3 grain silos of Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Strategic Grain Reserve Department. 

Before this application, the silo managers used to forward details (photos of receipts) of supplies through WhatsApp. This way, collation and analysis of records of supplies to silos were very rigorous and inaccurate.

The department wanted an application that can transmit data in real time to headquarters in Abuja and in a form that will analysis and evaluation easy.

There are weighbridges installed by Chinese company in the 3 silos. The weighbridges store data in Microsoft Access Database.

The program starts every time the computer starts running. It waits for a little while for the router to be ready. When the router is ready, it gets connected to Microsoft Access Database. It retrieves all current records, connects the remote server and sends the records.

If some records fail to be sent as a result of network failure, the next check on Microsoft Access Database for current records, another attempt will be made to send them.

If the router goes off, there will be a message on that and reconnection is made. In addition, log files are created to show more details when a problem occurs.
